- Community engagement events

## Getting Started

### How do I install Chronocast?
```bash
pip install chronocast
```
For additional features:
```bash
pip install "chronocast[audio_tools]"  # Audio features
pip install "chronocast[matplotlib_tools]"  # Visualization
```

### How do I create my first experience?
1. Install Chronocast
2. Create a Host with your desired personality
3. Configure your experience settings
4. Start the experience
```python
from chronocast import Host, Experience, OpenaiModels

host = Host(
    host_id="my_first_host",
    role="Storyteller",
    goal="Create engaging stories"
)

experience = Experience.create(
    host=host,
    title="My First Experience"
)
experience.start()
```

## Hosts and AI Models

### Which AI model should I choose?
- For storytelling: GPT-4 Turbo or Claude 3 Opus
- For educational content: Claude 3 Opus or GPT-4 Turbo
- For quick interactions: GPT-3.5 Turbo or Mixtral
- For multi-modal content: Gemini Pro or GPT-4 Vision

### How do I customize my Host's personality?
Use the `attributes` parameter to define your Host's traits:
```python
host = Host(
    host_id="storyteller",
    role="Fantasy Storyteller",
    attributes="You are a charismatic and imaginative storyteller who excels at creating immersive fantasy worlds"
)
```

### Can I use multiple AI models?
Yes! You can set up fallback models for reliability:
```python
host = Host(
    host_id="reliable_host",
    llm=[OpenaiModels.gpt_4_turbo, AnthropicModels.claude_3_opus]
)
```

## Interactive Features

### How do I enable voice interactions?
Configure voice settings in your experience:
```python
experience = Experience.create(
    host=host,
    interaction_modes={
        "voice": {
            "enabled": True,
            "voice_id": "default",
            "language": "en-US"
        }
    }
)
```

### Can I create branching narratives?
Yes! Enable branching in your experience settings:
```python
experience = Experience.create(
    host=host,
    settings={
        "branching": True,
        "choices": True,
        "memory": "session"
    }
)
```

### How do I handle viewer interactions?
Use event handlers to process viewer interactions:
```python
@experience.on_viewer_choice
def handle_choice(choice):
    response = experience.host.process_choice(choice)
    experience.send_response(response)
```

## Content Creation

### How do I create dynamic content?
Enable dynamic content generation in your settings:
```python
experience = Experience.create(
    host=host,
    adaptation_settings={
        "content_style": "dynamic",
        "pacing": "adaptive"
    }
)
```

### Can I save and load experiences?
Yes! Use state management functions:
```python
# Save state
state = experience.save_state()

# Load state later
experience.load_state(state)
```

### How do I add visual elements?
Use the visualization tools:
```python
from chronocast import VisualizationTools

host = Host(
    host_id="visual_storyteller",
    tools={VisualizationTools.image_generation}
)
```

## Technical Questions

### What are the API rate limits?
Rate limits depend on your AI model provider. We recommend:
1. Using fallback models
2. Implementing retry logic
3. Monitoring usage

### How do I handle errors?
Implement error handling:
```python
try:
    experience.start()
except ExperienceError as e:
    experience.handle_error(e)
    experience.recover()
```

### Can I customize the streaming settings?
Yes! Configure streaming parameters:
```python
experience = Experience.create(
    host=host,
    stream_settings={
        "buffer_size": "adaptive",
        "quality": "high",
        "latency": "low"
    }
)
```

## Billing and Usage

### How is usage calculated?
Usage is based on:
- AI model tokens used
- Audio processing minutes
- Image generation credits
- Streaming bandwidth

### How can I optimize costs?
1. Choose cost-effective models for simpler tasks
2. Use caching for repeated content
3. Optimize response lengths
4. Monitor and adjust usage patterns

### Is there a free tier?
Yes! Our free tier includes:
- Limited monthly tokens
- Basic audio features
- Community support
- Example templates
